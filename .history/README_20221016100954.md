    Install
    PyCaret is tested and supported on the following 64-bit systems:
        Python 3.6 â€“ 3.8
        Python 3.9 for Ubuntu only
        Ubuntu 16.04 or later
    #   Windows 7 or later
    Install PyCaret with Python's pip package manager.
        pip install pycaret
    To install the full version (see dependencies below):
        pip install pycaret[full]
    If you want to try our nightly build (unstable) you can install pycaret-nightly from pip.
        pip install pycaret-nightly
    Environment
    In order to avoid potential conflicts with other packages, it is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment, e.g. python3 virtualenv (see python3 virtualenv documentation) or conda environments. Using an isolated environment makes it possible to install a specific version of pycaret and its dependencies independently of any previously installed Python packages. 
    # create a conda environment
    conda create --name yourenvname python=3.8

    # activate conda environment
    conda activate yourenvname

    # install pycaret
    pip install pycaret

    # create notebook kernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name yourenvname --display-name "display-name"
    PyCaret is not yet compatible with sklearn>=0.23.2.

    #   For MAC OS

    MAC users will have to install LightGBM separately using Homebrew, or it can be built using CMake and Apple Clang (or gcc). See the instructions below:

    Install CMake (3.16 or higher):

        >> brew install cmake
        Install OpenMP
        >> brew install libomp
        Run the following commands in terminal:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM ; cd LightGBM
        mkdir build ; cd build
        cmake ..
        make -j4
